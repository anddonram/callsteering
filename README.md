Call Steering classification problem solved using scikit-learn


Call steering allows users to interact with systems in a conversational manner. The system identifies the sentence
and tries to extract the intent of the user. Finally, the system routes the call to the right department or individual.

In this repo there is a list of sentences labeled with one of eighteen categories for bank-related tasks and issues. 
Thus, we realize this is a classification problem. We will use scikit-learn for solving this.
